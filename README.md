## Features

### 🔍 Real-Time Monitoring
- Advanced object detection and tracking for immediate threat identification
- Live video feed processing with minimal latency
- Multi-camera support for comprehensive coverage

### 🚨 Anomaly Detection
- Detection of unusual behavior patterns 
- Identification of sudden movements like running
- Recognition of crowd formation and potential gatherings

### 📊 Predictive Analytics
- Historical pattern analysis for proactive threat prevention
- Data-driven insights for security resource allocation
- Trend visualization for security planning

### ⚡ Instant Alerts
- Real-time notification system for security personnel
- Multi-channel alerting (dashboard, email, mobile)
- Configurable alert thresholds

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 19 for modern UI components
- React Router for navigation

## Usage

### Dashboard
The Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of all connected cameras and monitoring systems. Security personnel can:
- View live feeds from multiple cameras
- Receive real-time alerts about detected anomalies
- Access historical data and analytics

### Dataset Management
The Dataset section allows administrators to:
- Manage training data for the machine learning models
- View detection accuracy statistics
- Fine-tune the system parameters

## Deployment

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```

The built assets will be available in the `dist` directory.
